Classifying and Creating hand drawn images from the Google QuickDraw Dataset

We have separate code for the GANs to generate images and CNN to classify it so check them out.

If you are interested in playing pictionary with the classifier and having it guess your drawing, look at the Drawing Game code.

Have fun!
